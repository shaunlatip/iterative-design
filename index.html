              <p>
                We’ve designed a web application for Circular, a startup that aims to democratize technology by allowing users to experience new technology before fully committing — users initially rent a product, and if they enjoy it, they can choose to buy the product. 
                <br><br>We’ve targeted two types of users: ones who are new to the website, and ones who are current users. The website is designed to be comprehensive enough to lead a potential user to explore all of Circular’s offerings and find a product that they would love to experience. Once a steady base of users has been built up, the website begins to serve a second purpose: to allow current users to manage their current products, continue finding new products to try, and to configure their desires in the most effective way.

              <h3>Sketching</h3>
              <p>
                We created 4 different possible designs for circular below, trying to capture a broad range of design alternatives for circular.
                <br><br>
                <b>An attached pdf with our sketches are shown below:</b>

              <h3>Wireframing</h3>

              <p>
                We then developed a series of wireframes integrating the best design ideas from our sketches.
                <br><br>
                We wanted to emphasize that the key idea of Circular is that it is a marketplace with unconventional means of renting the products. Our sketches were made of pages needed to create a functioning marketplace, and from there we created a flow that covered two use cases, first time users and returning customers. <br><br>Here are some of the ideas that guided our wireframing process:
              </p>

              <div class="focused-text-container" style="margin-top: 0;">

                <p>
                  We decided on having the users first go through a landing page because Circular’s company mission serves as a guide to how the marketplace works, as well as setting them apart from other marketplaces. 
                  <br><br>

                  A logged out state and logged in state exist for certain pages, to both prevent new users from being overwhelmed with information irrelevant in deciding to join the marketplace, and making the flow of information more efficient to returning users. E.g the explore page showcasing rental information in the logged in state, but is missing in the logged out state.
                  <br><br>

                  We wanted to make sure users are aware of the actions they can take when renting a rental,  so information regarding it was included in multiple areas, such as the Landing page in “HERE’S HOW IT WORKS” and the Product page in “What happens then?”.

                <h4 class="subtitle">Design Considerations</h4>
              <p>
                We then proceeded to convert our wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes. During this stage, we continued to refine our design with a few key principles in mind:
                <br>
              </p>

              <div class="focused-text-container" style="margin-top: 0;">
                <p>
                  We decided on an accent color of a bright pinkish red and roundness across our elements to convey a sense of newness, energy, and friendliness against more conventional, wholesale tech retailers, as circular is meant to widen the accessibility of technology through unconventional rentals.
                  <br><br>
                  We used our accent color sparingly with mostly-white backgrounds to encourage emphasis on the most important elements of each page, in addition to applying hierarchy to text.

              <h4 class="subtitle"><br>Our Methodology</h4>

              <p>
                For user testing, we first identified the two main functionalities of the interface that we would want users to explore:<br> 
                
                <div class="focused-text-container">
                  <ol>
                    <li>To start new rentals</li>
                    <li>To manage current rentals</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                These resulted in the following introduction prompt for users testing our mockup:

                <div class="focused-text-container">
                  "This is an interactive mockup website made on prototyping software. The website allows users to try out tech products before either buying or returning them. Imagine you're looking to buy and try out some new electronics."
                </div>

                <br>
                We then set up 4 sub-tasks that guide the users through the user flow: 
                
                <div class="focused-text-container">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Check out available categories</li>
                    <li>Select a category, browse the products, and select a specific product</li>
                    <li>Read about how renting works</li>
                    <li>Buy a product that they are currently renting</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                  After each sub-task, we also asked our users the following:

                </p>

                <div class="focused-text-container">

                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      To describe whether they felt they successfully completed the subtask
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      To rate the difficulty of the subtask from 1 to 5 (1 = Very Difficult, 5 = Very Easy)
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                </div>
                
                <br>
                <h4 class="subtitle"><br>Task Breakdown</h4>
                For each of the 4 sub-tasks, you can find the task description, our expectation on how the user would complete the task, and a summary of what each user actually did and their responses to the post-task questions.
                <br><br>Furthermore, we have marked, with a number (e.g. "(1)"), when a specific user's experience relates with a potential change we came up with after looking over our data, covered in the next section.

              <p>
                Overall, the three users were able to complete the tasks successfully and through the expected task flows. Most of their confusion came either from some incomplete functionalities (e.g. dummy buttons) of the interface as a prototype, or from how the task descriptions were worded. At the same time, some of their confusion does reflect certain problems with our interface, and we have come up with a list of potential changes in response to these problems as well as the users’ oral feedback.
